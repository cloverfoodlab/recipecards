# Recipe Cards
---

Nice recipe card interface for Peachworks recipe data.

During development:

```
npm run start
```

As a starting point for a nice auto-rebuild flow.

(Assumes you have properly set set `PEACHWORKS_ACCOUNT_ID` and `PEACHWORKS_ACCESS_TOKEN` env vars)

You will need an env var defined for:

```
PEACHWORKS_ACCESS_TOKEN
PEACHWORKS_ACCOUNT_ID
```

In order for the API requests to work.

You can validate the _redirects and _headers rules/syntax using this nice tool:

```
