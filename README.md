# Recipe Cards
---

Nice recipe card interface for Peachworks recipe data.

```
npm run build
```

As a starting point.

You will need an env var defined for:

```
PEACHWORKS_ACCESS_TOKEN
PEACHWORKS_ACCOUNT_ID
```

In order for the API requests to work.

You can validate the _redirects and _headers rules/syntax using this nice tool:

```

```
